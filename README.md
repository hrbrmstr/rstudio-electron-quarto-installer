# rstudio-electron-quarto-installer

Download and install the latest macOS RStudio (electron) daily along with the latest Quarto.

Why?

The electron build of RStudio does not require Rosetta and is coming along nicely. 

Also, the RStudio dev team is making tons of progress with each build so I download it frequently. 

Quarto and RStudio are joined at the hip and one often has to update a local Quarto install immediately after installing the latest RStudio daily.

## Installation

- Download the script
- Move it to a place on your `$PATH`
- Ensure it is executable (i.e. `chmod 755 /path/tp/rstudio-quarto-daily.zsh`)

## WARNING

Via [this issue](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/rstudio-electron-quarto-installer/issues/2), Apple Silicion RStudio Electron hates `qmd` files.

If `qmd` files are detected as being open in your RStudio session, you will be prompted to reset your RStudio Desktop state before the script will attempt to install RStudio Electron.

## NOTE

- It will check if any local Quarto and RStudio installs are at the latest already.
- It will also check if the DMG and/or pkg files are already downloaded
- It quits running RStudio instances without asking
- It can clobber stuff in `/tmp` if similarly named files already exist
- The script still lacks _some_ error checking.

## Usage

```bash
$ rstudio-quarto-daily.zsh
Installing latest macOS RStudio (electron) and latest Quarto

NOTE: You may be prompted at least once for your password for operations that require the use of 'sudo'
